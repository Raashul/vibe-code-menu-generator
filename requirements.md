## High Level
I want to create a Menu translation web app where user can either take a photo or upload a photo of a menu. The app should be able to read the image which contains text describing the food items. By integrating LLN, translate the meny and generate a photo for each item in the menu along with a short description. 

## Flow
1. Think deeply about the architecture and create a mermaid sequence diagram (mmd file) and put it in the /docs folder
2. Suggest the technical implementation. Tell me what LLM you are considering to use.


### Caveat
This is a full-stack application. For front-end lets use React with typescript and for backend lets use Node.js.
