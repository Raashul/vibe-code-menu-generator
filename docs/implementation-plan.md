# Menu Translation App - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup ✅
- [x] Initialize monorepo structure with frontend and backend
- [x] Setup React + TypeScript + Vite for frontend
- [x] Setup Node.js + Express + TypeScript for backend
- [x] Configure development environment and scripts
- [x] Add basic linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier)

## Phase 2: Backend Core ✅
- [x] Create Express server with CORS and file upload middleware
- [x] Implement `/api/translate` endpoint for image processing
- [x] Add error handling middleware
- [x] Setup environment variables for API keys
- [x] Add request validation and file type checking

## Phase 3: OCR Integration ✅
- [x] Research and choose OCR solution (Tesseract.js vs Google Vision API)
- [x] Implement text extraction from uploaded images
- [x] Add error handling for unreadable images
- [x] Test with various menu image formats

## Phase 4: LLM Integration ✅
- [x] Setup OpenAI API client or alternative LLM service
- [x] Create prompt template for menu parsing and translation
- [x] Implement structured response parsing (JSON schema)
- [x] Add retry logic for failed LLM requests
- [x] Handle multiple languages and cuisines

## Phase 5: Image Generation ✅
- [x] Integrate DALL-E 3 or alternative image generation API
- [x] Create prompts for food image generation
- [x] Implement batch image generation for menu items
- [x] Add fallback for failed image generation
- [x] Optimize image sizes and formats

## Phase 6: Real-time WebSocket Integration ⚡
- [ ] Setup WebSocket server with Socket.IO
- [ ] Implement real-time progress updates for translation pipeline
- [ ] Send OCR results via WebSocket as soon as extracted
- [ ] Send LLM translation results in real-time
- [ ] Stream image generation results as each image completes
- [ ] Add WebSocket error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] Create WebSocket event types and message schema

## Phase 7: Frontend Development
- [ ] Create main app layout and routing
- [ ] Build image upload component with drag & drop
- [ ] Add camera capture functionality for mobile
- [ ] Create loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Build menu display components
- [ ] Add responsive design for mobile/desktop
- [ ] Integrate WebSocket client for real-time updates

## Phase 8: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling on frontend
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile testing and optimization

## Phase 9: Polish & Deployment
- [ ] Add final UI polish and animations
- [ ] Setup Docker containers for deployment
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Deploy to hosting platform (Railway/Vercel)
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging

## Technical Decisions to Make
1. **OCR Service**: Tesseract.js (free, offline) vs Google Vision API (accurate, paid)
2. **LLM Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision vs Claude vs Gemini Pro
3. **Image Generation**: DALL-E 3 vs Midjourney vs Stable Diffusion
4. **Hosting**: Railway vs Vercel vs AWS
5. **Error Handling**: How to handle partial failures (some items translated, others failed)

## Key Features to Implement
- Real-time processing status updates
- Multiple language support
- Menu item categorization (appetizers, mains, desserts)
- Cost estimation display
- Download translated menu as PDF/image
- Shareable menu links (temporary URLs)
